        <h3>ENCODE Metrics</h3>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.encodeproject.org/">ENCODE Consortium</a> defines guidelines has established
        some definite guidelines for evaluating ChIP-seq samples. These include the
        <strong>PCR Bottlenecking Coefficient (PBC)</strong> and the <strong>Non-Redundant Fraction (NRF)</strong> for
          measuring library complexity in sequencing experiments.</p>

          <div class="panel-heading">PBC (PCR Bottleneck Coefficient 1)</div>
          <div class="panel panel-body">
            The PBC is a measure of library complexity, evaluating if the data is skewed
            towards certain read locations. This is calculated by:

        <h3>CWL Metrics</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.commonwl.org/">CWL</a> stands for <strong>Common Workflow Language</strong>,
          which is used for specifying analysis workflows across different environments.
          <a href="http://reddylab.org/">The Reddy Lab</a> uses a specific CWL pipeline for processing raw
        ChIP-seq data, producing many useful QC metrics for validating samples such as <strong>Number of Reads
            In Peaks</strong> from utilizing <a href="http://liulab.dfci.harvard.edu/MACS/">MACS peak calling software</a>
          and <strong>Number of Mapped Reads</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Fingerprint Metrics</h3>
        <p>The fingerprint analysis was developed by
          <a href="http://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">deepTools</a>,
          a bioinformatics suite developed by the Bioinformatics Facility at the Max Planck Institute for
          Immunobiology and Epigenetics in Freiburg. The fingerprint analysis measures the <strong>
            level of enrichment versus background noise </strong> (experimental control) since ChIP-seq experiments
          in particular are susceptible to noise.</p>
